LIRI READ ME


Liri is an app that is designed to be a one stop for all your concert info/ song info/ movie info!  It does this for the users convenience, so they dont have to go through many different services!  It is also an exersize in using node and the many different libraries that it contains.
The app is organzied by different commands that the user can put in.  These are 'concert-this', 'movie-this', 'spotify-this-song', and 'do-this'. These will then give out response based on the results of the query!
When booting up the app, you must first make your way to the folder in which the files are being held via the command line.  Once there type out 'node liri.js COMMAND whateverYouWantToSearch' and this will run the command.  If you enter the 'do-this' command, it will be a surprise!

My name is Jamie Barton and I am the sole developer behind this app.
